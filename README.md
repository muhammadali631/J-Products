This project is centered around creating a Python script to automate the process of extracting product information from the website of a competitor in the FMCG textile sector. The script leverages the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content and requests to fetch web pages. The goal is to gather detailed data about products, such as names, prices, original prices, colors, wear types, product categories, collections, fabrics, and fit types. This data is then compiled into a structured format using Pandas, making it easier to analyze the competitor's product offerings.

The script works by first fetching the main product page and then extracting links to individual product pages. For each product, it extracts the name, price, original price (if available), and additional attributes like color and fabric type. This process is repeated across multiple pages of products to ensure a comprehensive dataset. The extracted information is stored in a Pandas DataFrame, which is then exported to an Excel file for further analysis or reporting.

This automated approach to competitor analysis is highly efficient, reducing the time and effort required to gather actionable market intelligence. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries, the script offers a scalable solution for businesses looking to gain insights into the competitive landscape of the FMCG textile industry. The project showcases the potential of web scraping in strategic business applications, offering a foundation that can be adapted to various needs or expanded to cover more extensive data collection tasks.
